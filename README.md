### Hello, my name is Shirley!

I'm currently a third year undergraduate at the University of Toronto's iSchool pursuing a Bachelor of Information. Some roles I hold include the Director of Partnerships for Students in Data Science and Statistics and the VP of Outreach for the Bachelor of Information Student Association (BISA). I have always been intrigued by the idea of AI and have been learning about the world of cybersecurity lately!

In my spare time, you'll probably find me thrifting (I love fashion), listening to music of all genres (probably house, hip hop, or rnb), or in the gym (I want to get gains)!

Chat with me!
